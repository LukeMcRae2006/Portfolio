        <h2> This is my portfolio, it is currently under construction, that is why it uh... looks so bad. I wanted to get it up and running because I will be hosting my games on the other page! To see the games, click the link down below! And as always, thank you for visiting my website! :D</h2>
        <p> ABOUT ME: I am currently a freshman at the University At Buffalo, studying computer science. In my free time I love doing projects and have completed many like making a video game, to making a 
            standing arcade machine that can play games from first generation all the way up to the ps5. I love helping others with their projects and learning more about the wonderful world of computers!
